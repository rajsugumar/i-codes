what is git ?
-------------
-Git is a open source and distributed version control system tool.

There are two types of VCS: 
---------------------------
-Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)
-Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)

CVCS:
-----
-Centralized VCS, store all files and enables team collaboration
-It works on a single repository to which users can directly access a central server
-It could be local or remote which is directly connected to each of the programmer’s workstation.
-Every operation is performed directly on the repository.

Disadvantage:
-------------
-It is not locally available
-Need to be connected to a network to perform any action
-Central server getting crashed or corrupted will result in losing the entire data of the project.

DVCS:
-----
-Distributed VCS, every contributor has a local copy or “clone”
-everyone maintains a local repository of their own
-which contains all the files and metadata present in the main repository.
-An operation called “pull” and affect changes to the main repository by an operation called
 “push” from their local repository.

Installation Steps:
------------------


key : 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
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

step1. Create EC2 instance.

Step2. install git 
        1.yum install git -y
	2.create working directory ----> mkdir demo -----> cd demo
        3.git init ---- it will create local repo name as master by default
	4.create file ----> vi test ----> [ xyz-code ]
	5.git add test .
	6.git commit -m " first comit "
	7.git status ----> untracked file changed to tracked file and says working tree clean.
	8.again vi test ----> second code . then commit directly by using git commit -am " xyz 	 	commit" (Note:once untracked file changes to tracked file then no need to use add we can 		directly commit by using -am. "a" refers as add)
	
Step3. code push to git hub
	1.git push --- it will shows neext step 
	2.git remote add origin <link> [we must create one git hub account then add one repository]
	3.git push origin master 
		-----> Username for 'https://github.com': : git hub user name
		-----> Password for 'https://rajsugumar@github.com': not git hub password we need to                        generate token ----> setting --> devoloper setting ---> access token --->                        generate token.

branch steps:

1. create branch ---> git branch branchname
2. git branch -- its shows master and branch 
3. swap form master to branch ---> git branch branchname
4.
